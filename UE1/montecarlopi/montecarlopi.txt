1) How many iterations does your implementation need to get a medium error of < 0.01% for
   the last 10000 iterations (means the result is within [3.1413, 3.1419])?

- Float Tries: 12914443
- Double Tries: 1843242
- Long Double Tries: 299901


2) List the most exact π representation using the C++ data-types float, double, and long
   double along with their storage in bytes for your system

Exact Pi: 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062

Most Exact Output of float Pi: 3.1415927410125732421875
Storage for float Pi: 4 bytes = 32 bit
1 bit sign, 8 bit exponent, 24 bit mantissa (23 bit stored because hidden bit)
--> 22 decimal digits after the comma are stored, but accurately only for up to 6 decimal digits

Most Exact Output of double Pi: 3.141592653589793115997963468544185161590576171875
Storage for float Pi: 8 bytes = 64 bit
1 bit sign, 11 bit exponent, 52 bit mantissa
--> 48 decimal digits after the comma are stored, but accurately only for up to 15 decimal digits

Most Exact Output of long double Pi: 3.14159265358979323851280895940618620443274267017841339111328125
Storage for float Pi: 16 bytes = 128 bit
1 bit sign, 15 bit exponent, 112 bit mantissa
--> 62 decimal digits after the comma are stored, but accurately only for up to 18 decimal digits
