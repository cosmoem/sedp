1) How many iterations does your implementation need to get a medium error of < 0.01% for
   the last 10000 iterations (means the result is within [3.1413, 3.1419])?

- Float Tries: 12914443
- Double Tries: 1843242
- Long Double Tries: 299901


2) List the most exact π representation using the C++ data-types float, double, and long
   double along with their storage in bytes for your system

TODO ????

Most Exact Output of float Pi: 3.141
Storage for float Pi: 4 bytes
--> 1 byte exponent (incl sign), 3 bytes mantissa --> 24bit

Most Exact Output of double Pi: 3.1415927
Storage for float Pi: 8 bytes
--> 12 bit exponent, 52bit mantissa

Most Exact Output of long double Pi: 3.141592741012573
Storage for float Pi: 16 bytes

3) How many bits of mantissa in a floating-point number are necessary to encode the first 20
   decimal digits of π?
